== SIMD Math Test ==
----
A performance comparison between different implementations of an SIMD vector using SSE2. The code is a modified version of the source code to [[Designing Fast Cross-Platform|http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4248/designing_fast_crossplatform_simd_.php]] by Gustavo Oliveira.

;VMath
: An SIMD implementation where the __m128 data type is typedefed as a 4D vector.
;XNAMath
: Microsoft implementation included with DirectX.
;VClass
: An SIMD implementation where the __m128 data type is wrapped in a C++ class and used as a 4D vector.
;VClassWithTypedef
: An SIMD implementation where the __m128 data type is typedefed. A 4D vector is then built upon the __m128 typedef.
;VClassWithSIMDType
: An SIMD implementation where the __m128 data type is wrapped in a C++ class. A 4D vector is then built upon the SIMD class.

The goal of this comparison is to see if abstracting a low level SIMD interface and then using that interface to create math classes is a viable approach. This is the subject of a series of articles on #AltDevBlogADay.
